# The context
This proyect belongs to [Energetica 2030]() iniciative, concretely to [p8 - Microrredes](), conformed by 8 universities and 3 companies.
Energetica's goal is to define tranformation strategies for the electric sector in colombia for 2030.  

This proyect pretends to solve a problem relating data visualization.  
<br></br>

## The problem
Initially there will be placed five (5) living labs, each one of them is going to ve equipped with a solar panel.  
**The problem** begins when to want to obtain the data collected by the solar panel since the only way to access to these data is by the terminal
also the data is not presented in a legible way as shown below in *figure 1*.

*Figure 1*. Data collected by the solar panel shown from the terminal.

## The solution
Having the problem in mind a solution was thought: a software development that could connect with the solar panel, collect the panel's information and
allow it's visualization in graphs.
EAFIT's University solar panel was used as a testing unit.

## The results
Lastly the development implemented concludes agreeably by allowing the users to visualize the panel data efficiently.
